Based on our .clinerules file:

### AAC Representation Guidelines

- **Grid Layouts:** Maintain accurate positioning of symbols in grid layouts
- **Color Coding:** Use authentic color coding that matches real AAC systems
- **Terminology:** Use precise AAC terminology (e.g., "core vocabulary," "fringe vocabulary")

### Sensory Considerations

- **Material Selection:** Prioritize soft, low-texture fabrics for sensory comfort
- **Tag Removal:** All products must be tagless with heat-transfer labels
- **Seam Construction:** Minimize seams and use flat-lock construction where possible
- **Print Techniques:** Avoid raised or textured prints that could cause sensory discomfort
- **Pre-washing:** All fabrics should be pre-washed for immediate softness

### Frontend Preferences
