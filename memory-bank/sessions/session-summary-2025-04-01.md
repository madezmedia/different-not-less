## Challenges Encountered
- **Challenge 1:** Comprehensive domain strategy planning
  - **Resolution/Workaround:** Created detailed architecture diagrams and documentation to clarify the domain strategy
- **Challenge 2:** Analytics implementation complexity
  - **Resolution/Workaround:** Developed modular documentation with clear code examples for each tracking component
- **Challenge 3:** Sanity CMS schema complexity
  - **Resolution/Workaround:** Created modular schema approach with clear documentation for content types

## Technical Decisions
- **Decision 1:** Use non-www as primary domain (difnotless.com)
  - **Rationale:** Shorter, more memorable URL that aligns with brand identity
  - **Alternatives Considered:** www subdomain as primary
- **Decision 2:** Implement Google Tag Manager for analytics
  - **Rationale:** Provides flexibility for adding/modifying tracking without code changes
  - **Alternatives Considered:** Direct GA4 implementation
- **Decision 3:** Use Docker Compose for n8n production deployment
  - **Rationale:** Simplifies environment setup and ensures consistency across environments
  - **Alternatives Considered:** Standalone installation, Kubernetes deployment
- **Decision 4:** Implement modular Sanity CMS schema
  - **Rationale:** Allows for flexible content modeling and easier maintenance
  - **Alternatives Considered:** Monolithic schema approach
