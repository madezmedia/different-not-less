## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: API Credit Optimization
- **Issue**: Need to optimize API credit usage between Claude and Cline
- **Solution**: Created a task division framework that leverages each assistant's strengths while minimizing API credit usage

### Challenge 2: Seamless Handoffs
- **Issue**: Ensuring continuity between assistants with different capabilities
- **Solution**: Established detailed handoff documentation requirements and communication protocols

### Challenge 3: Complex Workflow Management
- **Issue**: Managing the state transitions of images through the workflow
- **Solution**: Implemented a clear status system (Draft → In Review → Approved → In Use) with automated transitions in the n8n workflow

### Challenge 2: Integration with AI Image Generation
- **Issue**: Connecting Airtable with fal.ai for image generation
- **Solution**: Created a robust n8n workflow that handles the entire process, including error handling and logging

### Challenge 3: Website Component Flexibility
- **Issue**: Creating a reusable component that works across different contexts
- **Solution**: Developed a flexible HeroBanner component with props for collection, title, and subtitle, plus fallback states

## Decisions Made

1. **Cline as Planner & Tester, Claude as Implementer**
   - Decided to leverage Cline's planning and MCP capabilities for architecture and testing
   - Assigned implementation tasks to Claude to optimize API credit usage
   - Established clear handoff protocols between planning and implementation phases

2. **Detailed Implementation Specifications**
   - Decided to create comprehensive implementation guides for handoffs
   - Specified exact file structures, component interfaces, and code templates
   - Established documentation requirements for both assistants

3. **Four-Table Structure**
   - Decided to use four interconnected tables for maximum flexibility
   - Website Images, Image Generation Logs, Social Media Content, Image Templates

2. **Status-Based Workflow**
   - Implemented a status-based workflow for image management
   - Allows for clear tracking of image state throughout the process

3. **Template System for Prompts**
   - Created a template system for generation prompts
   - Enables consistent image generation across collections

4. **Responsive Component Design**
   - Implemented responsive design for all components
   - Ensures proper display across all device sizes

## Next Steps

1. **Test Collaboration Framework**
   - Apply the framework to an upcoming development task
   - Evaluate effectiveness and identify improvement opportunities
   - Refine the process based on real-world usage

2. **Document Framework in .clinerules**
   - Add successful patterns to .clinerules for future reference
   - Ensure both assistants are aware of the framework
   - Establish metrics for evaluating framework effectiveness

3. **Implement Additional API Endpoints**
   - Create endpoints for product images and social media previews
   - Enhance the existing hero banner endpoint with caching

2. **Expand n8n Workflows**
   - Create workflow for social media publishing
   - Implement analytics collection workflow
