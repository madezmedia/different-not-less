**Focus:** Implementation of Airtable image workspace for website and social media assets

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Created Airtable Image Workspace Demo Script**
   - Implemented a comprehensive demo script that showcases the complete workflow
   - Demonstrated creating, searching, and updating image records
   - Showed integration with image generation and social media workflows

2. **Implemented Website Integration**
   - Created API endpoint for fetching hero banners from Airtable
   - Developed reusable HeroBanner React component with loading/error states
   - Implemented responsive styling for all components

3. **Designed n8n Automation Workflow**
   - Created workflow for automated image generation
   - Implemented integration with fal.ai for AI image generation
   - Set up notification system for image generation results

4. **Created Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Documented Airtable schema in `airtable-image-workspace-schema.js`
   - Created workflow documentation in `airtable-image-workspace-workflows.md`
   - Included best practices for image naming, dimensions, and prompts

## Technical Details

### Components Created

1. **Demo Script**: `scripts/airtable-image-workspace-demo.js`
   - Simulates MCP commands to Airtable
   - Demonstrates the complete image workflow

2. **API Endpoint**: `pages/api/airtable/hero-banner.js`
   - Fetches hero banners for collection pages
   - Handles error states and fallbacks

3. **React Component**: `components/HeroBanner.js` and `components/HeroBanner.module.css`
   - Displays hero banners with loading and error states
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes

4. **n8n Workflow**: `n8n/image-generation-workflow.json`
   - Automates image generation process
   - Integrates with fal.ai API

### Documentation Created

1. **Schema Documentation**: `memory-bank/technical/airtable-image-workspace-schema.js`
   - Detailed schema for all tables and fields
   - Includes field types, descriptions, and examples

2. **Workflow Documentation**: `memory-bank/mcp/airtable-image-workspace-workflows.md`
   - Comprehensive workflow documentation
   - MCP integration examples
   - Best practices for image management

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Complex Workflow Management
- **Issue**: Managing the state transitions of images through the workflow
- **Solution**: Implemented a clear status system (Draft → In Review → Approved → In Use) with automated transitions in the n8n workflow

### Challenge 2: Integration with AI Image Generation
- **Issue**: Connecting Airtable with fal.ai for image generation
- **Solution**: Created a robust n8n workflow that handles the entire process, including error handling and logging

### Challenge 3: Website Component Flexibility
- **Issue**: Creating a reusable component that works across different contexts
- **Solution**: Developed a flexible HeroBanner component with props for collection, title, and subtitle, plus fallback states

## Decisions Made

1. **Four-Table Structure**
   - Decided to use four interconnected tables for maximum flexibility
   - Website Images, Image Generation Logs, Social Media Content, Image Templates

2. **Status-Based Workflow**
   - Implemented a status-based workflow for image management
   - Allows for clear tracking of image state throughout the process

3. **Template System for Prompts**
   - Created a template system for generation prompts
   - Enables consistent image generation across collections

4. **Responsive Component Design**
   - Implemented responsive design for all components
   - Ensures proper display across all device sizes

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Additional API Endpoints**
   - Create endpoints for product images and social media previews
   - Enhance the existing hero banner endpoint with caching

2. **Expand n8n Workflows**
   - Create workflow for social media publishing
   - Implement analytics collection workflow

3. **Enhance Image Templates**
   - Add more specialized templates for different image types
   - Create collection-specific templates with brand guidelines

4. **Implement Image Optimization**
   - Add automatic image optimization for web delivery
   - Implement responsive image srcset generation
