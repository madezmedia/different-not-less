# Session Summary: April 1, 2025

## Session Information
- **Date:** 2025-04-01
- **Duration:** 00:30
- **Focus Area:** Platform Management System Implementation and Shopify MCP Integration
- **Participants:** Claude, Cline, Michael Shaw

## Key Accomplishments
- Created comprehensive platform management system in Airtable
- Set up performance metrics tracking for all external platforms
- Created platform-specific tasks with due dates and priorities
- Attempted to troubleshoot Shopify MCP server connection issues

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Created External Platforms table in Airtable
- [x] Created Platform Tasks table in Airtable
- [x] Created Platform Metrics table in Airtable
- [x] Added key platforms (Shopify, Etsy, social media, etc.)
- [x] Created platform-specific tasks with due dates
- [x] Set up performance metrics for each platform
- [x] Updated activeContext.md with platform management system information
- [x] Updated progress.md with platform management system implementation details

## Challenges Encountered
- **Challenge 1:** Shopify MCP server connection issues
  - **Resolution/Workaround:** Attempted to manually start the server with environment variables, but still encountered "Not connected" errors. Will need further troubleshooting.
- **Challenge 2:** Organizing multiple external platforms in a coherent system
  - **Resolution/Workaround:** Created a three-table system (Platforms, Tasks, Metrics) with relationships between tables for comprehensive tracking.

## Technical Decisions
- **Decision 1:** Three-table architecture for platform management
  - **Rationale:** Separating platforms, tasks, and metrics provides clearer organization and allows for more detailed tracking of each aspect.
  - **Alternatives Considered:** Single table with all information, but this would be less flexible and harder to maintain.
- **Decision 2:** Performance metrics tracking with specific goals
  - **Rationale:** Setting clear, measurable goals for each platform provides benchmarks for success and helps prioritize efforts.
  - **Alternatives Considered:** Qualitative tracking only, but quantitative metrics provide more objective measurement of success.

## Code Changes
- **Repository:** different-not-less
- **Branch:** main
- **Key Files Modified:**
  - memory-bank/activeContext.md - Added platform management system information and new challenge
  - memory-bank/progress.md - Added platform management system implementation details and updated timestamp

## Knowledge Updates
- **Files Updated:**
  - memory-bank/activeContext.md - Added platform management system tasks and challenge
  - memory-bank/progress.md - Added platform management system implementation phases and updated recently completed tasks
- **New Documentation Created:**
  - None

## Next Steps
- [ ] Troubleshoot and fix Shopify MCP server connection (High Priority, 2 hours)
- [ ] Use Shopify MCP tools to update store configuration (High Priority, 3 hours)
- [ ] Connect platform tasks to implementation tasks (Medium Priority, 2 hours)
- [ ] Create dashboard for platform performance monitoring (Medium Priority, 4 hours)
- [ ] Implement regular platform review process (Low Priority, 1 hour)

## Notes for Next Session
- The Shopify MCP server connection issue needs to be resolved before we can proceed with Shopify store updates
- Consider exploring alternative methods for Shopify integration if MCP server issues persist
- Focus on completing the platform management system integration with existing implementation tasks

## Additional Notes
- The platform management system provides a foundation for tracking all external platforms throughout the product lifecycle
- Performance metrics will be particularly valuable for post-launch analysis
- Consider adding more detailed metrics for each platform as we get closer to launch
