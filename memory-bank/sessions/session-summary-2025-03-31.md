## Challenges Encountered
- **Challenge 1:** fal.ai API rate limiting
  - **Resolution/Workaround:** Implemented request queuing and exponential backoff strategy
- **Challenge 2:** Printify API inconsistencies between documentation and actual behavior
  - **Resolution/Workaround:** Created custom validation and error handling for API responses
- **Challenge 3:** Complex workflow state management
  - **Resolution/Workaround:** Implemented persistent workflow variables and checkpoint nodes
- **Challenge 4:** Comprehensive domain strategy planning
  - **Resolution/Workaround:** Created detailed architecture diagrams and documentation
- **Challenge 5:** Sanity CMS schema complexity
  - **Resolution/Workaround:** Developed modular schema approach with clear documentation

## Technical Decisions
- **Decision 1:** Use Docker Compose for n8n deployment
  - **Rationale:** Simplifies environment setup and ensures consistency across environments
  - **Alternatives Considered:** Standalone installation, Kubernetes deployment
- **Decision 2:** Implement webhook-based trigger system
  - **Rationale:** Allows for both manual and automated workflow triggering
  - **Alternatives Considered:** Scheduled execution, direct API calls
- **Decision 3:** Store design prompts and metadata in Airtable
  - **Rationale:** Provides easy access for non-technical team members to manage design inputs
  - **Alternatives Considered:** JSON files, dedicated database
- **Decision 4:** Use non-www as primary domain (difnotless.com)
  - **Rationale:** Shorter, more memorable URL that aligns with brand identity
  - **Alternatives Considered:** www subdomain as primary
- **Decision 5:** Implement Google Tag Manager for analytics
  - **Rationale:** Provides flexibility for adding/modifying tracking without code changes
  - **Alternatives Considered:** Direct GA4 implementation
