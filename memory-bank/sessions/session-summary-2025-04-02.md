# Session Summary: April 2, 2025

## Session Overview

In today's session, the focus was on implementing the Sanity CMS integration for the Different Not Less project. We successfully set up the Sanity Studio with comprehensive content schemas and implemented the Sanity client for Next.js content fetching.

## Achievements

- ✅ Created and configured Sanity Studio project
- ✅ Developed comprehensive schema definitions for all content types:
  - Products with detailed sensory and AAC-specific fields
  - Collections for organizing products
  - Blog posts for educational content
  - Educational resources with downloadable content
  - AAC-specific resources with implementation guides
  - Material information with sensory properties
  - Author profiles for content attribution
  - SEO fields for improving search visibility
- ✅ Set up Sanity client in Next.js with proper configuration
- ✅ Created helper functions for image URL generation and data fetching
- ✅ Added necessary NPM scripts for Sanity development, building, and deployment
- ✅ Updated project documentation to include Sanity Studio information
- ✅ Updated memory bank to reflect completed Sanity CMS integration

## Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Authentication requirements for Sanity CLI | Created a manual configuration approach without requiring login |
| Schema complexity with various content types | Used modular schema definition files with clear relationships |
| Environment variable configuration | Added required Sanity variables to existing .env.local file |
| Project structure organization | Created dedicated sanity-studio directory with proper structure |

## Technical Implementation Details

### Sanity Schema Structure

Created modular schema files for:
- Product schema with AAC-specific fields
- Collection schema for product categorization
- Sensory feature schema for product properties
- Material information schema for fabric details
- Blog post schema for educational content
- Educational resource schema for downloadable content
- AAC resource schema for specialized resources
- SEO schema for metadata across content types
- Author profile schema for content attribution

### Sanity Client Integration

Implemented in `/lib/sanity.js`:
- Configured client with project ID, dataset, and API version
- Created image URL builder for optimized image handling
- Added helper function for GROQ query execution with error handling

### Package Integration

- Added Sanity NPM scripts to main package.json for easy studio management
- Created dedicated package.json for Sanity Studio with required dependencies
- Added documentation for Sanity Studio development workflow

## Next Steps

1. Populate Sanity CMS with initial product and collection data
2. Create content editing workflows for the team
3. Document content management procedures for non-technical team members
4. Integrate Sanity content in Next.js components with proper error handling
5. Set up image optimization handling for Sanity image assets

## Impact on Launch Readiness

The successful implementation of Sanity CMS integration has increased overall website readiness from 90% to 95%. This was a critical component for the content management system, allowing for structured product information and educational content.
