# GitHub Projects MCP Integration - Project Update

## Overview

We've successfully implemented GitHub Projects integration with our MCP (Model Context Protocol) system. This integration allows us to automate project management tasks directly from our CI/CD pipeline and development workflows.

## What's Been Implemented

- **GitHub Projects MCP automation functions**
- **Configuration files for project, column, and view IDs**
- **Comprehensive documentation in the memory bank**
- **Integration with existing GitHub MCP automation**

## New Capabilities

The GitHub Projects MCP integration provides the following capabilities:

1. Add issues to GitHub Projects automatically
2. Move project cards between columns based on status changes
3. Create new project cards programmatically
4. Update project views with custom filters and settings

> ðŸ’¡ These functions use the GitHub GraphQL API to interact with GitHub Projects. The implementation includes configuration files to store project, column, and view IDs, making it easy to update and maintain.

## Next Steps

To complete the GitHub Projects integration, we need to:

- [ ] Update the configuration files with actual GitHub Project IDs
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflows to use the new functions
- [ ] Test the integration with our development workflow
- [ ] Train the team on using the new GitHub Projects features

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been added to the memory bank:

- `memory-bank/mcp/github-projects-workflows.md` - Detailed documentation on using the GitHub Projects MCP integration
- `scripts/github-mcp-automation.js` - Implementation of the GitHub Projects MCP functions
- `project-config.json`, `project-columns.json`, `project-views.json` - Configuration files for GitHub Projects

## Impact on Launch

This integration enhances our project management capabilities but is not critical for the April 2 launch. We've added it to the post-launch tasks to fully implement with actual project IDs and integrate it into our workflows.

The GitHub Projects MCP integration will be particularly valuable for managing post-launch tasks, bug tracking, and feature development after the initial release.

> ðŸš€ **Launch Countdown: 2 days until launch on April 2, 2025!**

## Implementation Details

### GitHub Projects MCP Functions

We've added the following functions to the GitHub MCP automation script:

1. **addIssueToProject** - Adds an existing GitHub issue to a GitHub Project
2. **moveProjectCard** - Moves a project card to a different column
3. **createProjectCard** - Creates a new card in a GitHub Project
4. **updateProjectView** - Updates a GitHub Project view

### Configuration Files

We've created three configuration files to store project, column, and view IDs:

1. **project-config.json** - Maps project names to their GitHub Project IDs
2. **project-columns.json** - Maps column names to their GitHub Project column IDs
3. **project-views.json** - Maps project names to their GitHub Project IDs and view names to their view IDs

These files must be updated with the actual IDs from your GitHub Projects before using the integration.

### Integration with GitHub Actions

The GitHub Projects MCP integration can be used in GitHub Actions workflows to automate project management tasks. For example:

- Automatically add issues to projects when they're created
- Move cards between columns based on PR status changes
- Create new cards for tasks that don't have issues

## Getting GitHub Project IDs

To get the IDs needed for the configuration files, you can use the GitHub GraphQL API Explorer:

1. Go to https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/explorer
2. Run a query to get your project IDs:

```graphql
query {
  viewer {
    projectsV2(first: 10) {
      nodes {
        id
        title
        views(first: 10) {
          nodes {
            id
            name
          }
        }
        fields(first: 20) {
          nodes {
            ... on ProjectV2SingleSelectField {
              id
              name
              options {
                id
                name
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Update the configuration files with the IDs from the query results.
